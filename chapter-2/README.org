* About
  C is one of the most successful programming lanugages of all time. It's both /low-level/ and /high-level/ which gives the ability to create a lot of useful things. One key feature is that it does not hide anything from the programmer, which could be lead to a good/bad effect.

* Things learned in this chapter
  + Basic C syntax, which is very easy :: is does not require anything more than few keywords
  + Coding in FORTRAN95 is quiet weird :: yet it seems like a clever language relative to the " /old days/ "
  + Mathematical review :: great common divisor is like an /old memory/ to me..
